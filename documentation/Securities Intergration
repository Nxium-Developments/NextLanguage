Sure, let's integrate security features into NextLanguage while maintaining all the mentioned functionalities:

1. **Syntax**: NextLanguage's syntax, akin to JavaScript, will prioritize readability and clarity to reduce the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities due to code complexity. Clear syntax encourages developers to write code that is easier to review and audit for security issues.

2. **Load Functionality**: The `load` keyword in NextLanguage will undergo strict validation to prevent arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities. The interpreter will verify the integrity of imported code structures or packages to ensure they are from trusted sources.

3. **File Management**: NextLanguage's file management functions will include built-in security checks to prevent unauthorized access and manipulation of files. It will enforce proper file permissions and sanitization to mitigate risks associated with file-related vulnerabilities such as directory traversal attacks.

4. **NodeJS Integration**: NextLanguage's integration with Node.js will adhere to Node.js security best practices. This includes utilizing secure coding patterns, validating inputs, and sanitizing outputs to prevent common vulnerabilities such as injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).

5. **File Extension**: NextLanguage's use of the `.nxl` extension will not only indicate the file's content but also serve as a security measure. The interpreter will validate file extensions to prevent the execution of potentially malicious files disguised with the `.nxl` extension.

6. **Execution**: NextLanguage's interpreter will implement sandboxing techniques to isolate and restrict the execution environment of NextLanguage code. This sandboxing will prevent malicious code from accessing sensitive system resources or executing unauthorized actions.

7. **Package Management**: NextLanguage's package management system will incorporate cryptographic signatures and checksums to verify the authenticity and integrity of packages. Additionally, it will enforce secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for package downloads to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

8. **Documentation**: NextLanguage's documentation tools will include security guidelines and best practices for developers to follow. This will promote secure coding practices and help developers identify and mitigate security risks in their code.

9. **Error Handling**: NextLanguage's robust error handling mechanisms will include specific error messages for security-related issues. This will aid developers in identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities during the development and testing phases.

10. **Concurrency**: NextLanguage's concurrency features will be designed with security in mind. Asynchronous operations will be carefully managed to prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity, while multithreading will be implemented with thread-safe techniques to avoid common concurrency vulnerabilities such as data races.

By integrating these security features into NextLanguage, developers can confidently build secure applications while leveraging its powerful functionalities and compatibility with the Node.js ecosystem.
