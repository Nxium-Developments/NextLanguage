features than the main branch. Which is currently not being updated
at the time being.

NextLangauge is an file reader and loader, which is able to
run Javascript from any file. Including an .txt file and many more.

Now with this unofficial branch of NextLanguage, we're bringing this

Patch Downloaders, and many more being developed.
