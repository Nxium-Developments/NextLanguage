    @output -----------------------------------------------------------------
    @output
    @output This is a output function, it sends whatever is written in here
    @output before the next line and send it to the console, you don't really
    @output need a comma on this. Or any of the other functions never really
    @output needed a comma, so have fun!
    @output
    @output -----------------------------------------------------------------

    @function [hello]:
        :output This is a hello Function message. You are only seeing this
            message because the call function called this hello function

            A little note for you is that, only output commands are being
            registered within @function and @if block chains. So you can't
            really do alot here yet. But I'm working on adding more commands.

    # The @if command is used to create if statements. The bug related to @if not executing
    # the @else block is now fixed.

    @if [x > 10]:
        :output This is a if statement, if X is greater than 10. You will see this message!
    @else
        :output Sadly, you changed this value (x). So you couldn't see the message I wrote for you :d

    # The bug where @output command can only output variables once is also fixed!

    # This a demonstration of the fix!
